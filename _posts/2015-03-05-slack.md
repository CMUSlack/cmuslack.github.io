Slack chat spaces are divided into rooms called “channels”, and we have many set up. There are several you’ll be in by default:

- <strong>#announcements</strong>: Important announcements and updates to the community
- <strong>#community-feedback</strong>: Feedback and ideas for improving the CMU community
- <strong>#cmu-news</strong>:  For sharing news about CMU and what impacts us
- <strong>#events</strong>: Discuss upcoming events in the community
- <strong>#intros</strong>: A place to introduce yourself

All other channels are opt-in.
